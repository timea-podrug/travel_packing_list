Travel Packing List is a web application built with React that helps you manage your travel packing by creating a to-do list of items you need to pack. It provides a user-friendly interface to add, remove, and track the progress of packing your items. The application also displays the percentage of items you have already packed, giving you a visual representation of your progress.

## Features

- Add items to the packing list, specifying the item name and quantity.
- Remove items from the packing list if they are no longer needed.
- Cross off items once you have packed them, providing a sense of accomplishment.
- Displays the percentage of items packed.
